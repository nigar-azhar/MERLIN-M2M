# MERLIN-M2M

## Description

This Java project performs Model-to-Model (M2M) transformation on a UML file that represents a game model. The transformation results in an XML file, which is utilized by MERLIN-endless-runner for game testing.

## Requirements

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nigar-azhar/MERLIN-M2M.git
   cd MERLIN-M2M
   
2. Open the project in eclipse.
3. Locate the Driver.java file.
4. Update the path of your UML file on line 39
5. Run the Driver.java file.

## Output

The transformation process will generate an XML file in the project directory. The generated XML file can then be used with MERLIN-endless-runner for game testing.
